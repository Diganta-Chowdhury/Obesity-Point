We present the design and evaluation of culturally Obesity Risk Prediction based on Human Activity Recognition, designed as a tool to help people predict their possible risk of obesity from our solution. 
In this thesis, we present the design and evaluation of culturally Obesity Risk Prediction
based on Human Activity Recognition, designed as a tool to help people predict their
possible risk of obesity from our solution. Users can set plans for seven days, 15 days, 30
days, and more to track their daily physical activity to predict a timeline for obesity. To
create our proposed deep learning model, we have developed a deep learning technique
based on three layered LSTM in google colab.
